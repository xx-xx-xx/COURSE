 1. Description
 --------------------------------------------------------------------

 This software is an exact simulation of the 3-rotor Wehrmacht (Heer
 and Luftwaffe) the 3-rotor Kriegsmarine M3 and the famous 4-rotor
 Kriegsmarine M4 model of the German Enigma cipher machine, as they
 were used during world war II from 1939 until 1945. You can select
 between the different models, choose different rotors or 'Walzen',
 preset the rotor wiring positions or 'Ringstellung' and switch
 letters by using plugs or 'Stecker'.

 The internal wiring of all rotors is identical to those used by
 Wehrmacht, Luftwaffe and Kriegsmarine. This simulator is therefore
 fully compatible with the real Enigma crypto machine and you can
 decode original messages and make your own encoded text.

 The extensive 22 page help file (use F1) contains the manual, how
 the German military used the Enigma, all the technical details and
 the story of Enigma.
