1	Mrs. Taylor got out of bed at five o'clock that morning; an hour ahead of her usual time for getting up. She moved around her attic room with the stealth of a burglar , making herself her morning cup of tea on the hotplate , and dressing quietly so as not to disturb her landlady, Mrs. Connell , on the floor below.
2	She dressed her tiny self carefully, donning a clean white camisole and her black Sunday frock. After she had drunk her tea and eaten a slice of thinly margarined toast she washed her cup and saucer in some water she had drawn from the bathroom the night before, and put them away on her "kitchen" shelf in the clothes closet. Then she tiptoed down the steep stairs to the bathroom and washed her face and hands; "a lick and a spit" as she called it.
3	When she returned to her room her seventy-six-year-old face shone with wrinkled cleanliness and excitement of the day. She combed her thinning gray hair and did it up with pins into an unsevere bun at the back of her head. Then, half-guiltily, she powdered her face and touched her cheeks with a rouge-tipped finger. Going over to her old trunk in the corner she extracted from its depths two pieces of jewellery wrapped in tissue paper. One of the pieces was a gold locket holding a faded photograph of her dead husband Bert, while the other was an old-fashioned gold chain bangle with a small lock shaped like a heart. She had lost the key of the bangle long ago, but it did not matter, her hands were now so thin that it slipped easily over her wrist.
4	When she had adjusted the jewellery she took her old black straw hat from its paper bag and put it on, primping a bit before the Woolworth mirror on the wall, smiling at herself and wishing that her false teeth were a little whiter.
5	All through her preparations she had been taking hurried glances at the alarm clock on the dresser, but now, when she was ready to go, she saw that she still had nearly two hours before the train time. The train left at seven o'clock Standard Time, which was eight o'clock Daylight Saving, and here it was only a quarter to six. Still, it would take a half hour to get downtown to the station, and she couldn't afford to be late on this day of days.
6	She unclasped her small cardboard suitcase and carefully checked its contents once again. There was a clean change of underwear, a towel and soap, some handkerchiefs, two pairs of black lisle stockings, Bert's picture in its frame, and one of the two boys in uniform, her blouse and blue serge skirt, and the red velvet dress that Mrs. Eisen had given her the year before. The dress didn't fit her, but she liked its rich colour and the feeling of opulence it gave, just to possess it.
7	Picking up her heavy Bible from the top of the dresser she said to herself, "I really should take it along, I guess. It'll will weigh me down, but I couldn't go anywhere without it." Quickly making up her mind she placed the Bible in the suitcase and fastened the lid .Then she sat down on the edge of the bed and let the wonderful coming events of the day take over her thoughts.
8	The idea for the trip had come to her about a week before, on the day she had received her July old-age pension cheque. She had been down to the main post-office, mailing a set of handcrocheted runners to her daughter-in-law Ruth in Montreal when the idea struck her. Seeing all the holiday crowds hurrying into the maw of the station had prompted her to go in and inquire about train times.
9	The hurry and excitement of the place had brought back the nostalgic memories of those happier times when she and Burt and young Johnnie -yes, and young Bert too, who was killed in Italy -had gone away sometimes in the summer. Their trips hadn't been long ones, and their destination was usually the home of her dead cousin Flora in Janesville, but they had been filled with all the hustle and bustle of getting ready, packing salmon and peanut-butter sandwiches for their lunches, and making sure Burt had the ticket. There had been the warm picnicky feeling going to the station on the streetcar, trying to keep young Bert from kneeling on the seat and brushing his feet on the man beside him (she wiped away a vagrant tear at the memory) and the awareness that she belonged to the crowds around her.
10	That was the thing she had missed most during the past few years, the feeling of being one with those about her. The knowledge that she was old and ignored by younger people sometimes caused her to wish she were dead, but then appalled by the irreverence of such thoughts she would take refuge in her Bible, which was now her only solace.
11	Her loneliness and the striving to live on her old-age pension made mere existence a hardship. Mrs. Connell, her landlady, was a kindly soul, not much younger than herself, but she had no conception of what it was like to be cooped up month after month in a dreary little room, without even a cat or a dog or a canary-nothing, but the four walls, an electric plate, a bed and a dresser.
12	Of course, she told herself, she could have gone to live with Johnnie and Ruth in Montreal, but she'd seen too much of that sort of thing in the past. When Johnnie had married down there after the war she had felt a sinking in the stomach at the thought that he too was leaving her. "Come on down there with me, Ma," he had said, but she had sensed the reluctance behind his words. "I'm not going to be a built-in baby sitter for my grandchildren," she had answered, trying to cover her sense of loss and disappointment under her bantering words. She was independent, a woman who had run her own home for years, and brought up her two boys on the skimpy and unreliable wages of a labourer husband. But sometimes her independence melted under her silent tears, and she wished that once, just once, somebody would need her again.
13	But today was not the time for such gloomy thoughts. She glanced at the clock and saw that it was after seven. She stood up, straightened her hat once more, and picking up the heavy suitcase, made her way from the room, closing the door silently behind her. She had no wish to waken Mrs. Connell and have to answer the surprised questions of that lady; this trip was going to be a secret one, known only to herself.
14	She hurried down the street through the cloying warmth of the summer morning as fast as the heavy bag would allow her. When she reached the streetcar stop she put the suitcase down on the sidewalk and searched in the purse for a car ticket. There was very little money left from her pension cheque, but by doing without a few things to eat over the past week she had managed to save the expenses for the trip.
15	When the streetcar came along she climbed aboard and sat down near the front of the car. She was aware of the stares from the men and the girls who were going to work, and she felt important for the first time in months. There was something friendly in the glances they gave her, and perhaps even a slight envy that she should be going away while they could only look forward to another stifling day in their offices and factories.
16	The downtown streets at this hour of the day were strange to her, but there a tired camaraderie among the people getting on and off the car which brought back memories she had almost forgotten; once again she saw herself as a young woman going to work as they were, stepping down from the open-sided cars they had in those days , proud of her narrow waist and new high-buttoned boots . She felt almost young again and smiled apologetically as a thin girl in slacks nearly tripped over her suitcase.
17	As they neared the station several people carrying pieces of luggage boarded the car, and Mrs. Taylor smiled at them as if they were partners in a conspiracy. Most of them smiled back at her, and she felt that the anticipation and preparation for a journey was only exceeded by its actual beginning.
18	When she alighted from the streetcar, a young man in army uniform took her suitcase from her, and holding her by the arm, led her across the street.
19	"This is a heavy bag for you to be carrying," he said in a conversational tone.
20	"It is a little heavy," she answered, "but I haven't far to go."
21	" Everybody seems to be going away today," he said, "I guess I won't get a seat on the northbound train."
22	"That's a shame," Mrs. Taylor answered, trying to keep up with the soldier's long strides. " Are you on leave? "
23	" Sort of . I was down here on a forty-eight-hour pass from camp. I should have been back last night. "
24	" I hope you don't get into trouble, " she said. She felt suddenly sorry for the young man-only a boy really. She wanted to tell him that both her sons had been overseas during the war, and that young Bert had been killed. But then she thought he might think she was bragging, or trying to make him feel bad because he'd been too young to go.
25	As they entered the cathedral-like station concourse she said to the young soldier, "I can manage now, thank you," and he stopped and placed the bag on the floor.
26	"If you're taking the northbound train I'll carry the suitcase to the gates for you," he offered.
27	" No .No, thank you. I'm taking the Montreal train," she answered.
28	" Well then, I'll have to leave you. Goodbye. Have a nice holiday, " he said .
29	"Yes," she whispered, her voice cracking with emotion. As he walked away she shouted after him, "Good luck, son!" She watched him disappear into the crowd and felt a nameless dread for what might be before him .He was such a nice polite young boy, but what was more he was the first person outside Mrs. Connell and the man at the grocery store that she had spoken to all week .
30	The man at the ticket window seemed surprised as she bought her ticket, but he stamped it on the back and handed it to her without a word. When she asked him where to get the Montreal train he pointed across the station to a queue of people lined up before a pair of gates, and she picked up her suitcase and made her way towards it.
31	The crowd was a good-natured one, as she had known it would be, and she spent several minutes taking stock of the other travellers. It was unbelievable that so many people had woken up this morning as she had done, with the idea of catching the same train. All night as she had tossed and turned in anticipation of the morning these other people had probably been doing the same thing, unknown to her. The knowledge that they all shared the same sense of immediacy seemed to bring them closer together, and they were united in their impatience to be going.
32	But Mrs. Taylor was not impatient. She knew the value of time -she who had so little of it left -and this waiting with the others in the crowded station was as exciting to her as reaching the end of the trip - more so in fact .
33	She looked about her at the young people with their overnight bags and their tennis rackets; at the older men carrying haversacks and fishing rods each looking a little sheepish like boys caught playing hookey; the three girls in the brand-new clothes whispering together ahead of her in the line; the young couple with the baby in the go -cart standing outside the queue , smiling at one another and talking together in French ; the two priests in white panama hats who nodded solemnly and looked hot and cool at the same time in their black alpaca jackets.
34	This was what she had looked forward to all week! It was just as she had expected it to be, and she didn't care if the gates never opened; the best part of any journey was the waiting for the train.
35	There was the sound of a small scuffle behind her, and a young woman's tired voice said, "Garry, stop that right now!"
36	Mrs. Taylor turned and saw a slight dark girl wearing a shabby suit trying vainly to hold a young baby in her arms while she tugged at a little boy who was swinging on the end of a harness. The boy was trying desperately to break away.
37	" Here, young man, where do you think you are going!" Mrs. Taylor said sternly, bending down and catching him around the waist. The child stopped struggling and looked at her in surprise.
38	" He has been a little devil all morning," his mother said. "He knows I can't do much with him while I've got the baby in my arms."
39	''Now you just stand still!" Mrs. Taylor warned, letting him go and smiling at the young woman to show that she did not mean to override her authority.
40	"He'll stop for you," the girl said. "At home he'll do anything for his grandma, but when he knows I've got the baby to look after, he takes advantage of it."
41	Mrs. Taylor nodded. "I know; I had two boys myself," she said,"Is the baby a boy, too?"
42	"Yes. Four months."
43	Mrs. Taylor reached over and pulled the light blanket from the baby's face. "He's a big boy for four months, isn't it?" she asked.
44	She learned that the young woman's name was Rawlinson, and that she was on her way to New Brunswick to join her husband who was in the Air Force. The girl's mother had wanted to come down to the station with her, but her arthritis had kept her at home. She also learned that her baby's name was Ian and that his mother was twenty-two years old.
45	She in turn told the girl that she had lived alone since her oldest boy's marriage, and that Johnnie now lived with his wife and a young daughter in Montreal. In answer to the other questions she also told the young woman that her husband and youngest son were dead, that she received the old-age pension, and that it wasn't enough in these days of high prices.
46	Mrs. Rawlinson said that a friend of her mother's went to the same church as Mrs. Taylor. Mrs. Taylor didn't recognize the woman's name, although she thought she knew who the girl meant: a stout woman with short-bobbed bluish hair who wore a Persian lamb coat in the winter.
47	She realized now that she had been starved for conversation, and she was so grateful for having met the young woman with the children.
48	"They should be opening the gates pretty soon," said the girl, looking at her wristwatch." The train is due to leave in twenty minutes. "
49	From the loudspeaker came the voice of the stationmaster announcing that the northbound train was due to leave. Mrs. Taylor thought about the nice young soldier who had overstayed his pass.
50	The little boy, Garry, indicated that he wanted to go to the toilet.
51	"Wait till we get on the train, dear," his mother pleaded desperately.
52	Mrs. Taylor said eagerly, "I'll hold the baby while you take him if you like. "
53	"Will you! Gee, that's swell!" the young woman exclaimed. She handed the baby over, and Mrs. Taylor cradled him in her arm, while the young mother and the little boy hurried away.
54	She pulled back the blanket once again from the baby's face and saw that he was awake. She placed her finger on his chin and smiled at him, and he smiled back at her. The moment took her back more years than she cared to remember, back to a time when young Bert was the same age. She was filled with the remembered happiness at those days, and she thought, "I'd give up every minute more I have to live just to be young again and have my boys and babies for one more day." Then to hide the quick tears that were starting from her eyes she began talking to the baby in her arms, rocking back and forth on her heels in a gesture not practised for years.
55	When the young woman and the little boy returned she gave up the baby reluctantly. She and the young woman stood talking together like old friends or like a mother and daughter-in-law. They discussed teething troubles, the housing shortage, and how hard it was to raise a family these days. They were so engrossed in their new-found friendship that they failed to notice when the man open the gates.
56	The crowd began pushing them from behind, and Mrs. Taylor picked up her suitcase in one hand and grasped Garry's harness with the other. Then, followed by Mrs. Rawlinson and the baby they climbed the set of iron stairs to the platform.
57	Mrs. Taylor's feet were aching after the long wait at the gates, but her face shone with happiness as she steered the small boy alongside the train. The boy's mother drew up to her, and they walked together to the day-coach steps where a trainman waited to help them aboard.
58	"You've got your hands full there, Granny," he said, picking up the little boy and depositing him in the vestibule of the car.
59	She was pleased that he mistook her for the children's grandmother, and she beamed at him, not attempting to correct his mistake.
60	Inside the coach she led the way to a pair of seats that faced each other at the end of the car, and dropped into one with a tired sigh. Then she held the baby while its mother took the harness off Garry and placed her small case and shopping bags on the luggage rack.
61	"Am I ever glad to get aboard!" Mrs. Rawlinson exclaimed. "I'd been dreading the wait at the station. Now I've only got to change trains in Montreal and I'll be all set."
62	"It's quite a job traveling with children," Mrs. Taylor sympathized. "Don't worry, I know. I've done enough of it in my day," she said with slight exaggeration.
63	Mrs . Rawlinson laid the baby on the seat beside her, before sitting back and relaxing against the cushions. The coach soon filled up, and several people eyed their double seat enviously. Mrs. Taylor was glad she had been able to get well up in the queue at the gates.
64	When the train started she moved over close to the window and pointed out to the little boy the buildings and streets they passed, and the tiny inconsequential people they were leaving behind them. Young Garry shouted excitedly, "Choo-Choo!" at every engine they passed in the yards.
65	The city looked hot and uncomfortable in the morning sun, and Mrs. Taylor was surprised that all the little ant-like people didn't simply jump on a train and get away from it. It was remarkable that the ones she could see walking the street were strangers to her now, as if there was no connection between them and the people on the train. They were a race apart, an earthbound race separated from herself by movement and time, and the sense of adventure of her and her fellows.
66	She picked out landmarks as the train gathered speed; the street she had lived on as a girl, now turned into industrial sites; the spinning mill where she had once worked; the soot-blackened park where she and Bert had walked so many years ago...
67	"We won't be getting into Montreal until supper time," Mrs. Rawlinson said from the opposite seat, intruding upon her memories.
''No."
69	"I'll bet you'll be glad to get there and see your grand-daughter?"
70	Mrs. Taylor shook her head. "I'm not going to Montreal today," she said sadly." I can't afford to go that far."
71	"But -but couldn't your son send you the fare?" asked the girl.
72	She had to protect Johnnie, who wasn't really mean, just forgetful. "Oh, he could, but I've never really cared to go that far," she lied.
73	"Well-well, where are you going then?" the young woman asked, her curiosity getting the best of her.
74	"Not very far. Just up the line a piece," Mrs. Taylor answered, smiling. "It's just a short trip."
75	The train seemed to flow across the underpasses marking the street. Soon the industrial areas were left behind, and they began rushing through the residential districts.
76	Mrs. Taylor was enthralled with the sight of the rows of houses as seen from the rear; yards waving with drying clothes, and every house having an individuality of its own. She only recognized some of the familiar streets after the train dad passed them, they looked so different when seen from her hurtling point of vantage.
77	In a few minutes the train began to slow down for an outlying station, and the conductor came along the car collecting tickets. When Mrs. Taylor handed him her small bit of paste-board, he asked, "Are you getting off here, Madam?"
78	"Yes, I am," Mrs. Taylor replied, colouring with embarrassment.
79	"Have you any luggage?"
80	She pointed to the suitcase at her feet, ashamed to face the stares of those who were watching her.
81	"Fine. I'll carry it off for you," the conductor said calmly as if old ladies took ten-cent train rides every day of the week.
82	She stood up then and said goodbye to the little boy, letting her hand rest for a long minute on his tousled head. She warned him to be a good boy and do what his mother told him.
83	" You must think I'm crazy just coming this far," she said to Mrs. Rawlinson." You see, I've wanted to take a trip for so long, and this was sort of-pretending."
84	The young woman shook the surprised look from her face. "No, I don't, Mrs. Taylor," she said." I wish you were coming all the way. I don't know what I'd have ever done without you to help me with Garry."
85	"It was nice being able to help. You'll never know how much I enjoyed it," Mrs. Taylor answered, her face breaking into a shy smile. "Goodbye, dear, and God bless you. Have a nice journey. "
86	"Goodbye," the young woman said. "Thanks! Thanks a lot!"
87	Mrs. Taylor stood on the station platform and waved at the young woman and her son, who waved back at her as the train began to move again. Then she picked up her bag and walked along the platform to the street.
88	When she boarded a streetcar the motorman looked down at her and said," You look happy; you must have had a swell vacation."
89	She smiled at him. "I had a wonderful trip," she answered.
1	Mrs. Taylor got out of bed at five o'clock that morning; an hour ahead of her usual time for getting up. She moved around her attic room with the stealth of a burglar , making herself her morning cup of tea on the hotplate , and dressing quietly so as not to disturb her landlady, Mrs. Connell , on the floor below.

35	There was the sound of a small scuffle behind her, and a young woman's tired voice said, "Garry, stop that right now!"
36	Mrs. Taylor turned and saw a slight dark girl wearing a shabby suit trying vainly to hold a young baby in her arms while she tugged at a little boy who was swinging on the end of a harness. The boy was trying desperately to break away.
37	" Here, young man, where do you think you are going!" Mrs. Taylor said sternly, bending down and catching him around the waist. The child stopped struggling and looked at her in surprise.
38	" He has been a little devil all morning," his mother said. "He knows I can't do much with him while I've got the baby in my arms."
39	''Now you just stand still!" Mrs. Taylor warned, letting him go and smiling at the young woman to show that she did not mean to override her authority.
40	"He'll stop for you," the girl said. "At home he'll do anything for his grandma, but when he knows I've got the baby to look after, he takes advantage of it."
41	Mrs. Taylor nodded. "I know; I had two boys myself," she said,"Is the baby a boy, too?"
42	"Yes. Four months."
43	Mrs. Taylor reached over and pulled the light blanket from the baby's face. "He's a big boy for four months, isn't it?" she asked.
44	She learned that the young woman's name was Rawlinson, and that she was on her way to New Brunswick to join her husband who was in the Air Force. The girl's mother had wanted to come down to the station with her, but her arthritis had kept her at home. She also learned that her baby's name was Ian and that his mother was twenty-two years old.
45	She in turn told the girl that she had lived alone since her oldest boy's marriage, and that Johnnie now lived with his wife and a young daughter in Montreal. In answer to the other questions she also told the young woman that her husband and youngest son were dead, that she received the old-age pension, and that it wasn't enough in these days of high prices.
46	Mrs. Rawlinson said that a friend of her mother's went to the same church as Mrs. Taylor. Mrs. Taylor didn't recognize the woman's name, although she thought she knew who the girl meant: a stout woman with short-bobbed bluish hair who wore a Persian lamb coat in the winter.
47	She realized now that she had been starved for conversation, and she was so grateful for having met the young woman with the children.
48	"They should be opening the gates pretty soon," said the girl, looking at her wristwatch." The train is due to leave in twenty minutes. "
49	From the loudspeaker came the voice of the stationmaster announcing that the northbound train was due to leave. Mrs. Taylor thought about the nice young soldier who had overstayed his pass.
50	The little boy, Garry, indicated that he wanted to go to the toilet.
51	"Wait till we get on the train, dear," his mother pleaded desperately.
52	Mrs. Taylor said eagerly, "I'll hold the baby while you take him if you like. "
53	"Will you! Gee, that's swell!" the young woman exclaimed. She handed the baby over, and Mrs. Taylor cradled him in her arm, while the young mother and the little boy hurried away.
54	She pulled back the blanket once again from the baby's face and saw that he was awake. She placed her finger on his chin and smiled at him, and he smiled back at her. The moment took her back more years than she cared to remember, back to a time when young Bert was the same age. She was filled with the remembered happiness at those days, and she thought, "I'd give up every minute more I have to live just to be young again and have my boys and babies for one more day." Then to hide the quick tears that were starting from her eyes she began talking to the baby in her arms, rocking back and forth on her heels in a gesture not practised for years.
55	When the young woman and the little boy returned she gave up the baby reluctantly. She and the young woman stood talking together like old friends or like a mother and daughter-in-law. They discussed teething troubles, the housing shortage, and how hard it was to raise a family these days. They were so engrossed in their new-found friendship that they failed to notice when the man open the gates.
56	The crowd began pushing them from behind, and Mrs. Taylor picked up her suitcase in one hand and grasped Garry's harness with the other. Then, followed by Mrs. Rawlinson and the baby they climbed the set of iron stairs to the platform.
57	Mrs. Taylor's feet were aching after the long wait at the gates, but her face shone with happiness as she steered the small boy alongside the train. The boy's mother drew up to her, and they walked together to the day-coach steps where a trainman waited to help them aboard.
58	"You've got your hands full there, Granny," he said, picking up the little boy and depositing him in the vestibule of the car.
59	She was pleased that he mistook her for the children's grandmother, and she beamed at him, not attempting to correct his mistake.
60	Inside the coach she led the way to a pair of seats that faced each other at the end of the car, and dropped into one with a tired sigh. Then she held the baby while its mother took the harness off Garry and placed her small case and shopping bags on the luggage rack.
61	"Am I ever glad to get aboard!" Mrs. Rawlinson exclaimed. "I'd been dreading the wait at the station. Now I've only got to change trains in Montreal and I'll be all set."
62	"It's quite a job traveling with children," Mrs. Taylor sympathized. "Don't worry, I know. I've done enough of it in my day," she said with slight exaggeration.
63	Mrs . Rawlinson laid the baby on the seat beside her, before sitting back and relaxing against the cushions. The coach soon filled up, and several people eyed their double seat enviously. Mrs. Taylor was glad she had been able to get well up in the queue at the gates.
64	When the train started she moved over close to the window and pointed out to the little boy the buildings and streets they passed, and the tiny inconsequential people they were leaving behind them. Young Garry shouted excitedly, "Choo-Choo!" at every engine they passed in the yards.
65	The city looked hot and uncomfortable in the morning sun, and Mrs. Taylor was surprised that all the little ant-like people didn't simply jump on a train and get away from it. It was remarkable that the ones she could see walking the street were strangers to her now, as if there was no connection between them and the people on the train. They were a race apart, an earthbound race separated from herself by movement and time, and the sense of adventure of her and her fellows.
66	She picked out landmarks as the train gathered speed; the street she had lived on as a girl, now turned into industrial sites; the spinning mill where she had once worked; the soot-blackened park where she and Bert had walked so many years ago...
67	"We won't be getting into Montreal until supper time," Mrs. Rawlinson said from the opposite seat, intruding upon her memories.
''No."
69	"I'll bet you'll be glad to get there and see your grand-daughter?"
70	Mrs. Taylor shook her head. "I'm not going to Montreal today," she said sadly." I can't afford to go that far."
71	"But -but couldn't your son send you the fare?" asked the girl.
72	She had to protect Johnnie, who wasn't really mean, just forgetful. "Oh, he could, but I've never really cared to go that far," she lied.
73	"Well-well, where are you going then?" the young woman asked, her curiosity getting the best of her.
74	"Not very far. Just up the line a piece," Mrs. Taylor answered, smiling. "It's just a short trip."
75	The train seemed to flow across the underpasses marking the street. Soon the industrial areas were left behind, and they began rushing through the residential districts.
76	Mrs. Taylor was enthralled with the sight of the rows of houses as seen from the rear; yards waving with drying clothes, and every house having an individuality of its own. She only recognized some of the familiar streets after the train dad passed them, they looked so different when seen from her hurtling point of vantage.
77	In a few minutes the train began to slow down for an outlying station, and the conductor came along the car collecting tickets. When Mrs. Taylor handed him her small bit of paste-board, he asked, "Are you getting off here, Madam?"
78	"Yes, I am," Mrs. Taylor replied, colouring with embarrassment.
79	"Have you any luggage?"
80	She pointed to the suitcase at her feet, ashamed to face the stares of those who were watching her.
81	"Fine. I'll carry it off for you," the conductor said calmly as if old ladies took ten-cent train rides every day of the week.
82	She stood up then and said goodbye to the little boy, letting her hand rest for a long minute on his tousled head. She warned him to be a good boy and do what his mother told him.
83	" You must think I'm crazy just coming this far," she said to Mrs. Rawlinson." You see, I've wanted to take a trip for so long, and this was sort of-pretending."
84	The young woman shook the surprised look from her face. "No, I don't, Mrs. Taylor," she said." I wish you were coming all the way. I don't know what I'd have ever done without you to help me with Garry."
85	"It was nice being able to help. You'll never know how much I enjoyed it," Mrs. Taylor answered, her face breaking into a shy smile. "Goodbye, dear, and God bless you. Have a nice journey. "
86	"Goodbye," the young woman said. "Thanks! Thanks a lot!"
87	Mrs. Taylor stood on the station platform and waved at the young woman and her son, who waved back at her as the train began to move again. Then she picked up her bag and walked along the platform to the street.
88	When she boarded a streetcar the motorman looked down at her and said," You look happy; you must have had a swell vacation."
89	She smiled at him. "I had a wonderful trip," she answered.
56	The crowd began pushing them from behind, and Mrs. Taylor picked up her suitcase in one hand and grasped Garry's harness with the other. Then, followed by Mrs. Rawlinson and the baby they climbed the set of iron stairs to the platform.
57	Mrs. Taylor's feet were aching after the long wait at the gates, but her face shone with happiness as she steered the small boy alongside the train. The boy's mother drew up to her, and they walked together to the day-coach steps where a trainman waited to help them aboard.

84	The young woman shook the surprised look from her face. "No, I don't, Mrs. Taylor," she said." I wish you were coming all the way. I don't know what I'd have ever done without you to help me with Garry."
1	Mrs. Taylor got out of bed at five o'clock that morning; an hour ahead of her usual time for getting up. She moved around her attic room with the stealth of a burglar , making herself her morning cup of tea on the hotplate , and dressing quietly so as not to disturb her landlady, Mrs. Connell , on the floor below.
2	She dressed her tiny self carefully, donning a clean white camisole and her black Sunday frock. After she had drunk her tea and eaten a slice of thinly margarined toast she washed her cup and saucer in some water she had drawn from the bathroom the night before, and put them away on her "kitchen" shelf in the clothes closet. Then she tiptoed down the steep stairs to the bathroom and washed her face and hands; "a lick and a spit" as she called it.
3	When she returned to her room her seventy-six-year-old face shone with wrinkled cleanliness and excitement of the day. She combed her thinning gray hair and did it up with pins into an unsevere bun at the back of her head. Then, half-guiltily, she powdered her face and touched her cheeks with a rouge-tipped finger. Going over to her old trunk in the corner she extracted from its depths two pieces of jewellery wrapped in tissue paper. One of the pieces was a gold locket holding a faded photograph of her dead husband Bert, while the other was an old-fashioned gold chain bangle with a small lock shaped like a heart. She had lost the key of the bangle long ago, but it did not matter, her hands were now so thin that it slipped easily over her wrist.
4	When she had adjusted the jewellery she took her old black straw hat from its paper bag and put it on, primping a bit before the Woolworth mirror on the wall, smiling at herself and wishing that her false teeth were a little whiter.
5	All through her preparations she had been taking hurried glances at the alarm clock on the dresser, but now, when she was ready to go, she saw that she still had nearly two hours before the train time. The train left at seven o'clock Standard Time, which was eight o'clock Daylight Saving, and here it was only a quarter to six. Still, it would take a half hour to get downtown to the station, and she couldn't afford to be late on this day of days.
6	She unclasped her small cardboard suitcase and carefully checked its contents once again. There was a clean change of underwear, a towel and soap, some handkerchiefs, two pairs of black lisle stockings, Bert's picture in its frame, and one of the two boys in uniform, her blouse and blue serge skirt, and the red velvet dress that Mrs. Eisen had given her the year before. The dress didn't fit her, but she liked its rich colour and the feeling of opulence it gave, just to possess it.
7	Picking up her heavy Bible from the top of the dresser she said to herself, "I really should take it along, I guess. It'll will weigh me down, but I couldn't go anywhere without it." Quickly making up her mind she placed the Bible in the suitcase and fastened the lid .Then she sat down on the edge of the bed and let the wonderful coming events of the day take over her thoughts.
8	The idea for the trip had come to her about a week before, on the day she had received her July old-age pension cheque. She had been down to the main post-office, mailing a set of handcrocheted runners to her daughter-in-law Ruth in Montreal when the idea struck her. Seeing all the holiday crowds hurrying into the maw of the station had prompted her to go in and inquire about train times.
9	The hurry and excitement of the place had brought back the nostalgic memories of those happier times when she and Burt and young Johnnie -yes, and young Bert too, who was killed in Italy -had gone away sometimes in the summer. Their trips hadn't been long ones, and their destination was usually the home of her dead cousin Flora in Janesville, but they had been filled with all the hustle and bustle of getting ready, packing salmon and peanut-butter sandwiches for their lunches, and making sure Burt had the ticket. There had been the warm picnicky feeling going to the station on the streetcar, trying to keep young Bert from kneeling on the seat and brushing his feet on the man beside him (she wiped away a vagrant tear at the memory) and the awareness that she belonged to the crowds around her.
10	That was the thing she had missed most during the past few years, the feeling of being one with those about her. The knowledge that she was old and ignored by younger people sometimes caused her to wish she were dead, but then appalled by the irreverence of such thoughts she would take refuge in her Bible, which was now her only solace.
11	Her loneliness and the striving to live on her old-age pension made mere existence a hardship. Mrs. Connell, her landlady, was a kindly soul, not much younger than herself, but she had no conception of what it was like to be cooped up month after month in a dreary little room, without even a cat or a dog or a canary-nothing, but the four walls, an electric plate, a bed and a dresser.
12	Of course, she told herself, she could have gone to live with Johnnie and Ruth in Montreal, but she'd seen too much of that sort of thing in the past. When Johnnie had married down there after the war she had felt a sinking in the stomach at the thought that he too was leaving her. "Come on down there with me, Ma," he had said, but she had sensed the reluctance behind his words. "I'm not going to be a built-in baby sitter for my grandchildren," she had answered, trying to cover her sense of loss and disappointment under her bantering words. She was independent, a woman who had run her own home for years, and brought up her two boys on the skimpy and unreliable wages of a labourer husband. But sometimes her independence melted under her silent tears, and she wished that once, just once, somebody would need her again.
13	But today was not the time for such gloomy thoughts. She glanced at the clock and saw that it was after seven. She stood up, straightened her hat once more, and picking up the heavy suitcase, made her way from the room, closing the door silently behind her. She had no wish to waken Mrs. Connell and have to answer the surprised questions of that lady; this trip was going to be a secret one, known only to herself.
14	She hurried down the street through the cloying warmth of the summer morning as fast as the heavy bag would allow her. When she reached the streetcar stop she put the suitcase down on the sidewalk and searched in the purse for a car ticket. There was very little money left from her pension cheque, but by doing without a few things to eat over the past week she had managed to save the expenses for the trip.
15	When the streetcar came along she climbed aboard and sat down near the front of the car. She was aware of the stares from the men and the girls who were going to work, and she felt important for the first time in months. There was something friendly in the glances they gave her, and perhaps even a slight envy that she should be going away while they could only look forward to another stifling day in their offices and factories.
16	The downtown streets at this hour of the day were strange to her, but there a tired camaraderie among the people getting on and off the car which brought back memories she had almost forgotten; once again she saw herself as a young woman going to work as they were, stepping down from the open-sided cars they had in those days , proud of her narrow waist and new high-buttoned boots . She felt almost young again and smiled apologetically as a thin girl in slacks nearly tripped over her suitcase.
17	As they neared the station several people carrying pieces of luggage boarded the car, and Mrs. Taylor smiled at them as if they were partners in a conspiracy. Most of them smiled back at her, and she felt that the anticipation and preparation for a journey was only exceeded by its actual beginning.
18	When she alighted from the streetcar, a young man in army uniform took her suitcase from her, and holding her by the arm, led her across the street.
19	"This is a heavy bag for you to be carrying," he said in a conversational tone.
20	"It is a little heavy," she answered, "but I haven't far to go."
21	" Everybody seems to be going away today," he said, "I guess I won't get a seat on the northbound train."
22	"That's a shame," Mrs. Taylor answered, trying to keep up with the soldier's long strides. " Are you on leave? "
23	" Sort of . I was down here on a forty-eight-hour pass from camp. I should have been back last night. "
24	" I hope you don't get into trouble, " she said. She felt suddenly sorry for the young man-only a boy really. She wanted to tell him that both her sons had been overseas during the war, and that young Bert had been killed. But then she thought he might think she was bragging, or trying to make him feel bad because he'd been too young to go.
25	As they entered the cathedral-like station concourse she said to the young soldier, "I can manage now, thank you," and he stopped and placed the bag on the floor.
26	"If you're taking the northbound train I'll carry the suitcase to the gates for you," he offered.
27	" No .No, thank you. I'm taking the Montreal train," she answered.
28	" Well then, I'll have to leave you. Goodbye. Have a nice holiday, " he said .
29	"Yes," she whispered, her voice cracking with emotion. As he walked away she shouted after him, "Good luck, son!" She watched him disappear into the crowd and felt a nameless dread for what might be before him .He was such a nice polite young boy, but what was more he was the first person outside Mrs. Connell and the man at the grocery store that she had spoken to all week .
30	The man at the ticket window seemed surprised as she bought her ticket, but he stamped it on the back and handed it to her without a word. When she asked him where to get the Montreal train he pointed across the station to a queue of people lined up before a pair of gates, and she picked up her suitcase and made her way towards it.
31	The crowd was a good-natured one, as she had known it would be, and she spent several minutes taking stock of the other travellers. It was unbelievable that so many people had woken up this morning as she had done, with the idea of catching the same train. All night as she had tossed and turned in anticipation of the morning these other people had probably been doing the same thing, unknown to her. The knowledge that they all shared the same sense of immediacy seemed to bring them closer together, and they were united in their impatience to be going.
32	But Mrs. Taylor was not impatient. She knew the value of time -she who had so little of it left -and this waiting with the others in the crowded station was as exciting to her as reaching the end of the trip - more so in fact .
33	She looked about her at the young people with their overnight bags and their tennis rackets; at the older men carrying haversacks and fishing rods each looking a little sheepish like boys caught playing hookey; the three girls in the brand-new clothes whispering together ahead of her in the line; the young couple with the baby in the go -cart standing outside the queue , smiling at one another and talking together in French ; the two priests in white panama hats who nodded solemnly and looked hot and cool at the same time in their black alpaca jackets.
34	This was what she had looked forward to all week! It was just as she had expected it to be, and she didn't care if the gates never opened; the best part of any journey was the waiting for the train.
35	There was the sound of a small scuffle behind her, and a young woman's tired voice said, "Garry, stop that right now!"
36	Mrs. Taylor turned and saw a slight dark girl wearing a shabby suit trying vainly to hold a young baby in her arms while she tugged at a little boy who was swinging on the end of a harness. The boy was trying desperately to break away.
37	" Here, young man, where do you think you are going!" Mrs. Taylor said sternly, bending down and catching him around the waist. The child stopped struggling and looked at her in surprise.
38	" He has been a little devil all morning," his mother said. "He knows I can't do much with him while I've got the baby in my arms."
39	''Now you just stand still!" Mrs. Taylor warned, letting him go and smiling at the young woman to show that she did not mean to override her authority.
40	"He'll stop for you," the girl said. "At home he'll do anything for his grandma, but when he knows I've got the baby to look after, he takes advantage of it."
41	Mrs. Taylor nodded. "I know; I had two boys myself," she said,"Is the baby a boy, too?"
42	"Yes. Four months."
43	Mrs. Taylor reached over and pulled the light blanket from the baby's face. "He's a big boy for four months, isn't it?" she asked.
44	She learned that the young woman's name was Rawlinson, and that she was on her way to New Brunswick to join her husband who was in the Air Force. The girl's mother had wanted to come down to the station with her, but her arthritis had kept her at home. She also learned that her baby's name was Ian and that his mother was twenty-two years old.
45	She in turn told the girl that she had lived alone since her oldest boy's marriage, and that Johnnie now lived with his wife and a young daughter in Montreal. In answer to the other questions she also told the young woman that her husband and youngest son were dead, that she received the old-age pension, and that it wasn't enough in these days of high prices.
46	Mrs. Rawlinson said that a friend of her mother's went to the same church as Mrs. Taylor. Mrs. Taylor didn't recognize the woman's name, although she thought she knew who the girl meant: a stout woman with short-bobbed bluish hair who wore a Persian lamb coat in the winter.
47	She realized now that she had been starved for conversation, and she was so grateful for having met the young woman with the children.
48	"They should be opening the gates pretty soon," said the girl, looking at her wristwatch." The train is due to leave in twenty minutes. "
49	From the loudspeaker came the voice of the stationmaster announcing that the northbound train was due to leave. Mrs. Taylor thought about the nice young soldier who had overstayed his pass.
50	The little boy, Garry, indicated that he wanted to go to the toilet.
51	"Wait till we get on the train, dear," his mother pleaded desperately.
52	Mrs. Taylor said eagerly, "I'll hold the baby while you take him if you like. "
53	"Will you! Gee, that's swell!" the young woman exclaimed. She handed the baby over, and Mrs. Taylor cradled him in her arm, while the young mother and the little boy hurried away.
54	She pulled back the blanket once again from the baby's face and saw that he was awake. She placed her finger on his chin and smiled at him, and he smiled back at her. The moment took her back more years than she cared to remember, back to a time when young Bert was the same age. She was filled with the remembered happiness at those days, and she thought, "I'd give up every minute more I have to live just to be young again and have my boys and babies for one more day." Then to hide the quick tears that were starting from her eyes she began talking to the baby in her arms, rocking back and forth on her heels in a gesture not practised for years.
55	When the young woman and the little boy returned she gave up the baby reluctantly. She and the young woman stood talking together like old friends or like a mother and daughter-in-law. They discussed teething troubles, the housing shortage, and how hard it was to raise a family these days. They were so engrossed in their new-found friendship that they failed to notice when the man open the gates.
56	The crowd began pushing them from behind, and Mrs. Taylor picked up her suitcase in one hand and grasped Garry's harness with the other. Then, followed by Mrs. Rawlinson and the baby they climbed the set of iron stairs to the platform.
57	Mrs. Taylor's feet were aching after the long wait at the gates, but her face shone with happiness as she steered the small boy alongside the train. The boy's mother drew up to her, and they walked together to the day-coach steps where a trainman waited to help them aboard.
58	"You've got your hands full there, Granny," he said, picking up the little boy and depositing him in the vestibule of the car.
59	She was pleased that he mistook her for the children's grandmother, and she beamed at him, not attempting to correct his mistake.
60	Inside the coach she led the way to a pair of seats that faced each other at the end of the car, and dropped into one with a tired sigh. Then she held the baby while its mother took the harness off Garry and placed her small case and shopping bags on the luggage rack.
61	"Am I ever glad to get aboard!" Mrs. Rawlinson exclaimed. "I'd been dreading the wait at the station. Now I've only got to change trains in Montreal and I'll be all set."
62	"It's quite a job traveling with children," Mrs. Taylor sympathized. "Don't worry, I know. I've done enough of it in my day," she said with slight exaggeration.
63	Mrs . Rawlinson laid the baby on the seat beside her, before sitting back and relaxing against the cushions. The coach soon filled up, and several people eyed their double seat enviously. Mrs. Taylor was glad she had been able to get well up in the queue at the gates.
64	When the train started she moved over close to the window and pointed out to the little boy the buildings and streets they passed, and the tiny inconsequential people they were leaving behind them. Young Garry shouted excitedly, "Choo-Choo!" at every engine they passed in the yards.
65	The city looked hot and uncomfortable in the morning sun, and Mrs. Taylor was surprised that all the little ant-like people didn't simply jump on a train and get away from it. It was remarkable that the ones she could see walking the street were strangers to her now, as if there was no connection between them and the people on the train. They were a race apart, an earthbound race separated from herself by movement and time, and the sense of adventure of her and her fellows.
66	She picked out landmarks as the train gathered speed; the street she had lived on as a girl, now turned into industrial sites; the spinning mill where she had once worked; the soot-blackened park where she and Bert had walked so many years ago...
67	"We won't be getting into Montreal until supper time," Mrs. Rawlinson said from the opposite seat, intruding upon her memories.
''No."
69	"I'll bet you'll be glad to get there and see your grand-daughter?"
70	Mrs. Taylor shook her head. "I'm not going to Montreal today," she said sadly." I can't afford to go that far."
71	"But -but couldn't your son send you the fare?" asked the girl.
72	She had to protect Johnnie, who wasn't really mean, just forgetful. "Oh, he could, but I've never really cared to go that far," she lied.
73	"Well-well, where are you going then?" the young woman asked, her curiosity getting the best of her.
74	"Not very far. Just up the line a piece," Mrs. Taylor answered, smiling. "It's just a short trip."
75	The train seemed to flow across the underpasses marking the street. Soon the industrial areas were left behind, and they began rushing through the residential districts.
76	Mrs. Taylor was enthralled with the sight of the rows of houses as seen from the rear; yards waving with drying clothes, and every house having an individuality of its own. She only recognized some of the familiar streets after the train dad passed them, they looked so different when seen from her hurtling point of vantage.
77	In a few minutes the train began to slow down for an outlying station, and the conductor came along the car collecting tickets. When Mrs. Taylor handed him her small bit of paste-board, he asked, "Are you getting off here, Madam?"
78	"Yes, I am," Mrs. Taylor replied, colouring with embarrassment.
79	"Have you any luggage?"
80	She pointed to the suitcase at her feet, ashamed to face the stares of those who were watching her.
81	"Fine. I'll carry it off for you," the conductor said calmly as if old ladies took ten-cent train rides every day of the week.
82	She stood up then and said goodbye to the little boy, letting her hand rest for a long minute on his tousled head. She warned him to be a good boy and do what his mother told him.
83	" You must think I'm crazy just coming this far," she said to Mrs. Rawlinson." You see, I've wanted to take a trip for so long, and this was sort of-pretending."
84	The young woman shook the surprised look from her face. "No, I don't, Mrs. Taylor," she said." I wish you were coming all the way. I don't know what I'd have ever done without you to help me with Garry."
85	"It was nice being able to help. You'll never know how much I enjoyed it," Mrs. Taylor answered, her face breaking into a shy smile. "Goodbye, dear, and God bless you. Have a nice journey. "
86	"Goodbye," the young woman said. "Thanks! Thanks a lot!"
87	Mrs. Taylor stood on the station platform and waved at the young woman and her son, who waved back at her as the train began to move again. Then she picked up her bag and walked along the platform to the street.
88	When she boarded a streetcar the motorman looked down at her and said," You look happy; you must have had a swell vacation."
89	She smiled at him. "I had a wonderful trip," she answered.
1	Mrs. Taylor got out of bed at five o'clock that morning; an hour ahead of her usual time for getting up. She moved around her attic room with the stealth of a burglar , making herself her morning cup of tea on the hotplate , and dressing quietly so as not to disturb her landlady, Mrs. Connell , on the floor below.
2	She dressed her tiny self carefully, donning a clean white camisole and her black Sunday frock. After she had drunk her tea and eaten a slice of thinly margarined toast she washed her cup and saucer in some water she had drawn from the bathroom the night before, and put them away on her "kitchen" shelf in the clothes closet. Then she tiptoed down the steep stairs to the bathroom and washed her face and hands; "a lick and a spit" as she called it.
3	When she returned to her room her seventy-six-year-old face shone with wrinkled cleanliness and excitement of the day. She combed her thinning gray hair and did it up with pins into an unsevere bun at the back of her head. Then, half-guiltily, she powdered her face and touched her cheeks with a rouge-tipped finger. Going over to her old trunk in the corner she extracted from its depths two pieces of jewellery wrapped in tissue paper. One of the pieces was a gold locket holding a faded photograph of her dead husband Bert, while the other was an old-fashioned gold chain bangle with a small lock shaped like a heart. She had lost the key of the bangle long ago, but it did not matter, her hands were now so thin that it slipped easily over her wrist.
4	When she had adjusted the jewellery she took her old black straw hat from its paper bag and put it on, primping a bit before the Woolworth mirror on the wall, smiling at herself and wishing that her false teeth were a little whiter.
5	All through her preparations she had been taking hurried glances at the alarm clock on the dresser, but now, when she was ready to go, she saw that she still had nearly two hours before the train time. The train left at seven o'clock Standard Time, which was eight o'clock Daylight Saving, and here it was only a quarter to six. Still, it would take a half hour to get downtown to the station, and she couldn't afford to be late on this day of days.
6	She unclasped her small cardboard suitcase and carefully checked its contents once again. There was a clean change of underwear, a towel and soap, some handkerchiefs, two pairs of black lisle stockings, Bert's picture in its frame, and one of the two boys in uniform, her blouse and blue serge skirt, and the red velvet dress that Mrs. Eisen had given her the year before. The dress didn't fit her, but she liked its rich colour and the feeling of opulence it gave, just to possess it.
7	Picking up her heavy Bible from the top of the dresser she said to herself, "I really should take it along, I guess. It'll will weigh me down, but I couldn't go anywhere without it." Quickly making up her mind she placed the Bible in the suitcase and fastened the lid .Then she sat down on the edge of the bed and let the wonderful coming events of the day take over her thoughts.
8	The idea for the trip had come to her about a week before, on the day she had received her July old-age pension cheque. She had been down to the main post-office, mailing a set of handcrocheted runners to her daughter-in-law Ruth in Montreal when the idea struck her. Seeing all the holiday crowds hurrying into the maw of the station had prompted her to go in and inquire about train times.
9	The hurry and excitement of the place had brought back the nostalgic memories of those happier times when she and Burt and young Johnnie -yes, and young Bert too, who was killed in Italy -had gone away sometimes in the summer. Their trips hadn't been long ones, and their destination was usually the home of her dead cousin Flora in Janesville, but they had been filled with all the hustle and bustle of getting ready, packing salmon and peanut-butter sandwiches for their lunches, and making sure Burt had the ticket. There had been the warm picnicky feeling going to the station on the streetcar, trying to keep young Bert from kneeling on the seat and brushing his feet on the man beside him (she wiped away a vagrant tear at the memory) and the awareness that she belonged to the crowds around her.
10	That was the thing she had missed most during the past few years, the feeling of being one with those about her. The knowledge that she was old and ignored by younger people sometimes caused her to wish she were dead, but then appalled by the irreverence of such thoughts she would take refuge in her Bible, which was now her only solace.
11	Her loneliness and the striving to live on her old-age pension made mere existence a hardship. Mrs. Connell, her landlady, was a kindly soul, not much younger than herself, but she had no conception of what it was like to be cooped up month after month in a dreary little room, without even a cat or a dog or a canary-nothing, but the four walls, an electric plate, a bed and a dresser.
12	Of course, she told herself, she could have gone to live with Johnnie and Ruth in Montreal, but she'd seen too much of that sort of thing in the past. When Johnnie had married down there after the war she had felt a sinking in the stomach at the thought that he too was leaving her. "Come on down there with me, Ma," he had said, but she had sensed the reluctance behind his words. "I'm not going to be a built-in baby sitter for my grandchildren," she had answered, trying to cover her sense of loss and disappointment under her bantering words. She was independent, a woman who had run her own home for years, and brought up her two boys on the skimpy and unreliable wages of a labourer husband. But sometimes her independence melted under her silent tears, and she wished that once, just once, somebody would need her again.
13	But today was not the time for such gloomy thoughts. She glanced at the clock and saw that it was after seven. She stood up, straightened her hat once more, and picking up the heavy suitcase, made her way from the room, closing the door silently behind her. She had no wish to waken Mrs. Connell and have to answer the surprised questions of that lady; this trip was going to be a secret one, known only to herself.
14	She hurried down the street through the cloying warmth of the summer morning as fast as the heavy bag would allow her. When she reached the streetcar stop she put the suitcase down on the sidewalk and searched in the purse for a car ticket. There was very little money left from her pension cheque, but by doing without a few things to eat over the past week she had managed to save the expenses for the trip.
15	When the streetcar came along she climbed aboard and sat down near the front of the car. She was aware of the stares from the men and the girls who were going to work, and she felt important for the first time in months. There was something friendly in the glances they gave her, and perhaps even a slight envy that she should be going away while they could only look forward to another stifling day in their offices and factories.
16	The downtown streets at this hour of the day were strange to her, but there a tired camaraderie among the people getting on and off the car which brought back memories she had almost forgotten; once again she saw herself as a young woman going to work as they were, stepping down from the open-sided cars they had in those days , proud of her narrow waist and new high-buttoned boots . She felt almost young again and smiled apologetically as a thin girl in slacks nearly tripped over her suitcase.
17	As they neared the station several people carrying pieces of luggage boarded the car, and Mrs. Taylor smiled at them as if they were partners in a conspiracy. Most of them smiled back at her, and she felt that the anticipation and preparation for a journey was only exceeded by its actual beginning.
18	When she alighted from the streetcar, a young man in army uniform took her suitcase from her, and holding her by the arm, led her across the street.
19	"This is a heavy bag for you to be carrying," he said in a conversational tone.
20	"It is a little heavy," she answered, "but I haven't far to go."
21	" Everybody seems to be going away today," he said, "I guess I won't get a seat on the northbound train."
22	"That's a shame," Mrs. Taylor answered, trying to keep up with the soldier's long strides. " Are you on leave? "
23	" Sort of . I was down here on a forty-eight-hour pass from camp. I should have been back last night. "
24	" I hope you don't get into trouble, " she said. She felt suddenly sorry for the young man-only a boy really. She wanted to tell him that both her sons had been overseas during the war, and that young Bert had been killed. But then she thought he might think she was bragging, or trying to make him feel bad because he'd been too young to go.
25	As they entered the cathedral-like station concourse she said to the young soldier, "I can manage now, thank you," and he stopped and placed the bag on the floor.
26	"If you're taking the northbound train I'll carry the suitcase to the gates for you," he offered.
27	" No .No, thank you. I'm taking the Montreal train," she answered.
28	" Well then, I'll have to leave you. Goodbye. Have a nice holiday, " he said .
29	"Yes," she whispered, her voice cracking with emotion. As he walked away she shouted after him, "Good luck, son!" She watched him disappear into the crowd and felt a nameless dread for what might be before him .He was such a nice polite young boy, but what was more he was the first person outside Mrs. Connell and the man at the grocery store that she had spoken to all week .
30	The man at the ticket window seemed surprised as she bought her ticket, but he stamped it on the back and handed it to her without a word. When she asked him where to get the Montreal train he pointed across the station to a queue of people lined up before a pair of gates, and she picked up her suitcase and made her way towards it.
31	The crowd was a good-natured one, as she had known it would be, and she spent several minutes taking stock of the other travellers. It was unbelievable that so many people had woken up this morning as she had done, with the idea of catching the same train. All night as she had tossed and turned in anticipation of the morning these other people had probably been doing the same thing, unknown to her. The knowledge that they all shared the same sense of immediacy seemed to bring them closer together, and they were united in their impatience to be going.
32	But Mrs. Taylor was not impatient. She knew the value of time -she who had so little of it left -and this waiting with the others in the crowded station was as exciting to her as reaching the end of the trip - more so in fact .

35	There was the sound of a small scuffle behind her, and a young woman's tired voice said, "Garry, stop that right now!"
36	Mrs. Taylor turned and saw a slight dark girl wearing a shabby suit trying vainly to hold a young baby in her arms while she tugged at a little boy who was swinging on the end of a harness. The boy was trying desperately to break away.
37	" Here, young man, where do you think you are going!" Mrs. Taylor said sternly, bending down and catching him around the waist. The child stopped struggling and looked at her in surprise.
38	" He has been a little devil all morning," his mother said. "He knows I can't do much with him while I've got the baby in my arms."

87	Mrs. Taylor stood on the station platform and waved at the young woman and her son, who waved back at her as the train began to move again. Then she picked up her bag and walked along the platform to the street.
88	When she boarded a streetcar the motorman looked down at her and said," You look happy; you must have had a swell vacation."
89	She smiled at him. "I had a wonderful trip," she answered.
56	The crowd began pushing them from behind, and Mrs. Taylor picked up her suitcase in one hand and grasped Garry's harness with the other. Then, followed by Mrs. Rawlinson and the baby they climbed the set of iron stairs to the platform.
57	Mrs. Taylor's feet were aching after the long wait at the gates, but her face shone with happiness as she steered the small boy alongside the train. The boy's mother drew up to her, and they walked together to the day-coach steps where a trainman waited to help them aboard.
58	"You've got your hands full there, Granny," he said, picking up the little boy and depositing him in the vestibule of the car.
59	She was pleased that he mistook her for the children's grandmother, and she beamed at him, not attempting to correct his mistake.
60	Inside the coach she led the way to a pair of seats that faced each other at the end of the car, and dropped into one with a tired sigh. Then she held the baby while its mother took the harness off Garry and placed her small case and shopping bags on the luggage rack.
61	"Am I ever glad to get aboard!" Mrs. Rawlinson exclaimed. "I'd been dreading the wait at the station. Now I've only got to change trains in Montreal and I'll be all set."
62	"It's quite a job traveling with children," Mrs. Taylor sympathized. "Don't worry, I know. I've done enough of it in my day," she said with slight exaggeration.
63	Mrs . Rawlinson laid the baby on the seat beside her, before sitting back and relaxing against the cushions. The coach soon filled up, and several people eyed their double seat enviously. Mrs. Taylor was glad she had been able to get well up in the queue at the gates.
64	When the train started she moved over close to the window and pointed out to the little boy the buildings and streets they passed, and the tiny inconsequential people they were leaving behind them. Young Garry shouted excitedly, "Choo-Choo!" at every engine they passed in the yards.
65	The city looked hot and uncomfortable in the morning sun, and Mrs. Taylor was surprised that all the little ant-like people didn't simply jump on a train and get away from it. It was remarkable that the ones she could see walking the street were strangers to her now, as if there was no connection between them and the people on the train. They were a race apart, an earthbound race separated from herself by movement and time, and the sense of adventure of her and her fellows.
66	She picked out landmarks as the train gathered speed; the street she had lived on as a girl, now turned into industrial sites; the spinning mill where she had once worked; the soot-blackened park where she and Bert had walked so many years ago...
67	"We won't be getting into Montreal until supper time," Mrs. Rawlinson said from the opposite seat, intruding upon her memories.
''No."
69	"I'll bet you'll be glad to get there and see your grand-daughter?"
70	Mrs. Taylor shook her head. "I'm not going to Montreal today," she said sadly." I can't afford to go that far."
71	"But -but couldn't your son send you the fare?" asked the girl.
72	She had to protect Johnnie, who wasn't really mean, just forgetful. "Oh, he could, but I've never really cared to go that far," she lied.
73	"Well-well, where are you going then?" the young woman asked, her curiosity getting the best of her.
74	"Not very far. Just up the line a piece," Mrs. Taylor answered, smiling. "It's just a short trip."
75	The train seemed to flow across the underpasses marking the street. Soon the industrial areas were left behind, and they began rushing through the residential districts.
76	Mrs. Taylor was enthralled with the sight of the rows of houses as seen from the rear; yards waving with drying clothes, and every house having an individuality of its own. She only recognized some of the familiar streets after the train dad passed them, they looked so different when seen from her hurtling point of vantage.
77	In a few minutes the train began to slow down for an outlying station, and the conductor came along the car collecting tickets. When Mrs. Taylor handed him her small bit of paste-board, he asked, "Are you getting off here, Madam?"
78	"Yes, I am," Mrs. Taylor replied, colouring with embarrassment.
79	"Have you any luggage?"
80	She pointed to the suitcase at her feet, ashamed to face the stares of those who were watching her.
81	"Fine. I'll carry it off for you," the conductor said calmly as if old ladies took ten-cent train rides every day of the week.
82	She stood up then and said goodbye to the little boy, letting her hand rest for a long minute on his tousled head. She warned him to be a good boy and do what his mother told him.
83	" You must think I'm crazy just coming this far," she said to Mrs. Rawlinson." You see, I've wanted to take a trip for so long, and this was sort of-pretending."
84	The young woman shook the surprised look from her face. "No, I don't, Mrs. Taylor," she said." I wish you were coming all the way. I don't know what I'd have ever done without you to help me with Garry."
85	"It was nice being able to help. You'll never know how much I enjoyed it," Mrs. Taylor answered, her face breaking into a shy smile. "Goodbye, dear, and God bless you. Have a nice journey. "
86	"Goodbye," the young woman said. "Thanks! Thanks a lot!"
