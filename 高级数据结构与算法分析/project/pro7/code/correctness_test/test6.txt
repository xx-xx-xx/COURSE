Mrs. Taylor got out of bed at five o'clock that morning; an hour ahead of her usual time for getting up. She moved around her attic room with the stealth of a burglar , making herself her morning cup of tea on the hotplate , and dressing quietly so as not to disturb her landlady, Mrs. Connell , on the floor below. She dressed her tiny self carefully, donning a clean white camisole and her black Sunday frock. After she had drunk her tea and eaten a slice of thinly margarined toast she washed her cup and saucer in some water she had drawn from the bathroom the night before, and put them away on her "kitchen" shelf in the clothes closet. Then she tiptoed down the steep stairs to the bathroom and washed her face and hands; "a lick and a spit" as she called it. When she returned to her room her seventy-six-year-old face shone with wrinkled cleanliness and excitement of the day. She combed her thinning gray hair and did it up with pins into an unsevere bun at the back of her head. Then, half-guiltily, she powdered her face and touched her cheeks with a rouge-tipped finger. Going over to her old trunk in the corner she extracted from its depths two pieces of jewellery wrapped in tissue paper. One of the pieces was a gold locket holding a faded photograph of her dead husband Bert, while the other was an old-fashioned gold chain bangle with a small lock shaped like a heart. She had lost the key of the bangle long ago, but it did not matter, her hands were now so thin that it slipped easily over her wrist.
